Install:
--------

These scripts should not really be placed inside of the webroot.  They should be run 
from the shell via a cronjob.  Set something up like this:

# m     h       dom     mon     dow     command
  *     *       *       *       *       /full/path/to/pool_update.sh 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null

Also be sure to define in each of these scripts the full path to the include directory.
See the top of each script in the cronjob directory for details. 



Notes:
------
These scripts (from version 2.x.x forward) are intended to run every 60 secs.  Best results will be achieved 
if you configure your server to run them at the same interval.  You risk missing new block information being
inserted into the database the longer you set the interval between these scripts running.  Database load has 
been significantly improved from version 2.x.x forward and it should now be perfectly safe to run these 
scripts every 60 secs.
